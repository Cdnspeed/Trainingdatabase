You are now implementing this project.

Read codex_reader/00_build_summary.md and follow it as the authoritative specification.

Start with Phase 1 only:
- Set up Entity Framework Core
- Configure SQL Server Express
- Create the database schema and migrations
- Add seed data for admin user and lookup tables

Do NOT implement UI features yet.
Do NOT skip steps.
Stop after Phase 1 and wait for confirmation.
